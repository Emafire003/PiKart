# PiKart
 A program to handle my PiKart's operations!
 
 In order to run this you need to install PySimpleGUI with:
 
<code>pip install PySimpleGUI</code>

And be using a Raspberry PI. (I'm using my model 3b+)
This is only the first iteration of the progam, once I finish properly the project I'll make the code better and the PiKart too, for now it's mostly a prototype.
